# So what is it actually like?

* Imperfect.
* While popular packages are cached, a lot of software ends up getting built
  from source.
* Even when you make zero changes, rebuilds take about 20 seconds.
* This is especially annoying due to the subpar editor support for Nix, meaning 
  that most mistakes are only detected at build time, rather than as I type, 
  which really slows down the speed at which you can iterate.
* Some apps don't keep their icons while open, instead getting a "generic
  executable" icon.
* My laptop is convinced it is connected via ethernet even though it absolutely
  isn't.
* Occasionally, all my apps would disappear from the launcher after a rebuild.
  Terrifying!
* Aside from little patches of jank, it was mostly pretty decent though.
* Going into specifics, let's look at some of the things I tried out...
