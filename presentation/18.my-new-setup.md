# ¿Por Qué No Los Dos?

And so my plans for my system configuration are:

* NixOS for general system configuration and package management.
* Mise for management of developer tools, such as Gradle and Node.
* Docker for deploying my software on my server.
* For dotfiles management:
  * I am considering `home-manager` (a dotfile manager for NixOS), but did not 
    have time to experiment with it yet. I've heard it is pretty slow.
  * If that doesn't work, I'll have to keep looking. I haven't found anything
    ideal yet.

There are no gods of purity watching over us, despite what the NixOS wiki may
have you believe. Do what makes you happy, and don't stress about making things
perfect: perfection will not make you happy, but trying new things will, even if
you thought you didn't need them.
