# What's it like for programming?

* The fact that it isn't possible to globally install multiple versions of a 
  tool side-by-side is pretty annoying. 
* For interpreted languages, everything except binary dependencies works fine.
* But otherwise, you'll often need to manually configure dev shells for your 
  projects.
* A dev shell is basically the system-wide equivalent of a Python virtual 
  environment, with its own set of isolated dependencies.
* While dev shells work well once you set them up, the setup process is 
  ***incredibly*** tedious.
* Check out this dev shell configuration I had to set up for one of the 
  slideshow viewer I'm using in this presentation...
