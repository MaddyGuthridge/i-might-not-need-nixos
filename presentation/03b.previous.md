# My previous system

* Fedora Linux (rock solid, mostly)
* Most things installed with DNF
* A few things installed with Flatpak
* A few things installed with Snap if the Flatpak was broken
* Most of my developer tools installed using Mise, a tool we'll talk about later
* Configured entirely imperatively. To change my configuration, I would run 
  commands and modify settings dialogs.
* Simple, fast and reliable. Nothing important has ever broken for me on Fedora.
* However, it would be very difficult to reproduce the system state. I've 
  changed so many settings that it would take me weeks to set a new system up to
  the same standard.
