# Ok what if I use a desktop that isn't awful?

With 2 lines of configuration, I can set up and configure Gamescope, the
session that is also used by SteamOS. ***IT LITERALLY JUST WORKS!!!***

```nix
programs.steam.gamescopeSession.enable = true;
programs.gamescope.enable = true;
```

* For comparison, on most other distros, you neeed to run a bunch of scripts to
  get this to work.
