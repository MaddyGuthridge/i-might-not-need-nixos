# What I love about Mise

* It is so easy to use
* Everything just works
* It works on all systems with very little setup
* And it automatically changes versions of packages depending on your current 
  directory, so if I'm in a project that needs Node 22, it'll activate it 
  without me even needing to ask, and will switch back to the default version as
  soon as I'm done.
* If I gave a talk about this, I'd be done in 30 seconds, it's so simple.
