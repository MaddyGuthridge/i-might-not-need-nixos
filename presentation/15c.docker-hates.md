# What I hate about docker

* The config file is so imperative. Unlike Nix, I don't say "this is what I 
  want". Instead I say "this is how to get there", which is much more complex 
  most of the time.
* Build times even slower than Nix.
* Much less secure by default (being in the `docker` group makes you effectively
  `root`).
* It's hard to learn. Since you're running a full virtualised OS, you 
  essentially need to learn that OS as well as Docker.
* Comparatively slow to start and stop, which makes it a pain for development. I
  can't just open a folder and start typing.
