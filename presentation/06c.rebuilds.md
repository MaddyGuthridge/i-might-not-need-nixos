# I hope you like compiling

* While popular packages are cached, a lot of software ends up getting built
  from source.
  * ***NEVER TRY TO INSTALL CUDA FROM SOURCE***
* Even when you make zero changes, rebuilds take about 20 seconds.
* This is especially annoying due to the subpar editor support for Nix, meaning 
  that most mistakes are only detected at build time, rather than as I type, 
  which really slows down the speed at which you can iterate.
