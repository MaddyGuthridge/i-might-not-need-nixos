# What do I want from my system?

* Easy to configure.
* Lets me develop software without needing tedious setup for all my different 
  projects.
* Transparent: it should be clear what's going on with my system. I don't want 
  to have five different package managers, if I can avoid it.
* Reliable: breakages are a disaster. My system must always work when I need it
  to. I should be able to decide when it is down for upgrades.
